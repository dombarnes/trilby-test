  <h3>Early Days</h3>
  <p>Since the beginning of the web Trilby has always been at the forefront of media and software development. We worked with the very first National Grid for Learning (NGfL) creating online tools that pushed the limits of what technology could do. Getting students to create media rich content and work collaboratively across the borough on a scale not seen in education before.</p>

  
  <h3>Engaging Education</h3>
  <article>
  <p>As passionate and experienced individuals with a vast knowledge of applying technology, our role as consultants and trainers expanded. Our training in education as Apple Education Trainers and Google for Education Certified Trainers has taken us all over the UK and beyond sharing our learning.</p>

  <h3>TrilbyTV</h3>
  <article>
  <p>After visiting so many education institutions to deliver creative training and seeing screens turned off, we realised that we had the solution. TrilbyTV links the amazing work being produced with the available screens promoting sharing and showcasing in a simple and easy way. Putting the control of the signage content back into the students and teachers hands while providing a robust and affordable IT solution.</p>
